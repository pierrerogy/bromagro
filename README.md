# Epiphytic tank bromeliads and habitat complexity: a new opportunity for sustainable agriculture?

## Summary
The advent of the Green Revolution triggered a substantial increase in food production and human development. However, with the exponential increase in land use conversion, new challenges to control pests on vast expanses of resources arose. The main answer to this challenge was the consistent application of chemical control, which has proven effective to a certain extent. In fact, rising resistance to pesticides and negative ecological, economical, and health consequences have been hinting to the limitations of this model. There is thus a need for novel, alternative methods for sustainable pest management. In the Neotropics, tank bromeliads are common epiphytes throughout forest ecosystems, and are often found growing on and around a variety of crop trees. They are known to get obtain nutrients from water and debris falling between their leaves; yet they are consistently removed because traditionally seen as mistletoe-like parasites. Nonetheless, because of the habitat conditions they create, bromeliads are associated with numerous animals, especially arthropods. Those include many predators, such as scorpions, spiders and ants. In 2012, a research article suggested that bromeliads decrease leaf herbivory in their support tree.  As a result, there is potential for bromeliads to be used in biological control, transforming a relationship seen as commensal into a tritrophic mutualism. This research project will present an assessment of the role that bromeliad may play in an agricultural food webs through a [BACI](http://people.stat.sfu.ca/~cschwarz/Stat-650/Notes/PDFbigbook-SAS/SAS-part013.pdf) design.

## (Draft) hypotheses
(i) bromeliad size and density will have an indirect negative effect on leaf damage, because they increase predator presence in the tree

(ii) for the same reason, trees with bigger and more numerous bromeliads will have a more abundant predator community

(iii) because of consumptive and non-consumptive effects, a higher abundance of predators will result in a lower abundance of herbivores

(iv) higher herbivore abundance will result in higher leaf damage, because they preferentially say on their food plant

## Notes on R code
*lamona* or *mona* refer to vacuum sampling

*Square* means quadrat (i to iv) for each tree

propdamage is damage proportion, bounded between 0 and 1
